It would be very nice if somewhere, really anywhere, they would mention that you need to check in with the host instead on just the app!!!\n\nThen it was downhill from there.

My thoughts about the Gage and the experience (service, food, price) are even worse. It is not possible to pay almost $600 (with tips) and not to be satisfied at the end.

The MC (I guess that\u2019s what you\u2019d call him) was a great host. Very funny and did a great job setting the mood. The opener was an up an coming artist named Nick Alexander and he was incredible. Then the headliner was Jamiah Rogers who I guess is known in Chicago as the \u201cBlues Superman\u201d. He absolutely killed it. Almost 3 hours of amazing music, at one point he had almost the entire club on the dance floor going crazy.

Sat at the bar on a COLD Chicago evening, and we really enjoyed our meal. Our server, Yolanda, made the whole experience. Super fun, very attentive, made great recommendations. We had the chopped salad with chicken (outstanding house Italian dressing) and a deep-dish with several toppings--both great choices. The house chianti is good, as well. Had the pleasure of buying dinner for the Chicago Police officers seated nearby. Thanks for a great evening, Yolanda! We will be back."

Their pizza is also not very salty which is a huge plus for me because you can taste the freshness of the ingredients more this way. Prices are very reasonable and pick up is quick, about 20 minutes. The only downside is that parking is difficult and there isn't very much street parking available..be prepared to park in a red zone, put your blinkers on, and pay for your pizza and run back."
