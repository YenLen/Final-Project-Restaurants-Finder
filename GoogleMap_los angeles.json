The wine tasting was set up in such a way that there were plenty of knowledgeable servers and space to mingle with the other guests.\n\nThe food was plentiful and beautifully presented. There was a buffet of small dishes as well as many servers passing bites. It was a nice touch that later on they even brought around deserts.\n\nI really liked that although we had a private space we still were not completely separate from the remainder of the restaurant. The space was very open and you were not cornered off in some dark room for your private event.\n\nI would highly recommend this venue for your private party. Enjoy!"

Now with no bacon, I order a pastrami hot dog and a order of garlic fries. Great hot dog! Pickles and mustard on a great tasting bun! The fries tasted like they are infused with garlic. Just how garlic fries are suppose to taste! The owner Tim is winning with this place! Now I got to try that elote fries and all the rest of this delicious looking menu."

At first you think you will be hanging out in the front of the house until you are taken downstairs and welcomed to a very large space lit up with so much wine, bars and nooks with couches as well as high top community tables. Great service, they allow you to taste before you buy, and probably should with most glasses being 20+. They offer flight tastings also. It felt like a younger vibe with city workers celebrating an end to their work week. Fantastic vine list and a good place to come for a drink. I'd keep it at that only."

They have a dress code, which is basically no casual/gym clothes. If you want to fit in, dress like you're going to a nice club. All the women were wearing full beats. Men all had collars and long sleeves. And that was the brunch crowd. I couldn't find the price of the valet on their site, so here you go: It was $13 when I went.

If it wasn't for the sauce which has a great taste, the meats would not be very good.\n\nBothe Baked Beans and Chili Beans were the best parts of our meals.  They both had a spicy kick to them.  The Mac and Cheese was decent, but the Mac was a little over cooked.  Corn Bread was moist and had a nice Honey Butter."

However, I later found out that the excitement turned into a deep sadness. The sammie barely had any sustenance, it was 87.43% bread (which was ok quality I am told) and the remainder was \"filling\" if that is what you want to call it. The sammie left more of an emptiness than an actual feeling of gratification. Please talk to your staff and fix this issue as soon as you can \"Dan\".\n\nThanks,\n\nA concerned freind"

First, you wait in line to order, people tend to line up against the glass leaving a large space between person ordering and those in line. This may look like they have already ordered - not so. Once you order you go to the other side of the counter where it says Breakfast and pay there. Then you wait till your order is ready. While the flow may be slightly odd everyone is very nice and accommodating should you want to alter any sandwich or create one yourself.\n\nA solid lunch option since they are quick and easy, only serving sandwiches and salads. I tried the Bunker Club and it was ok. There was something oddly sweet about it, I think it was the ham but I'm still not too sure. It was about $13 for a sandwich, pickle, and a small side salad. Not too bad. I will return and perhaps build my own sandwich next time."
