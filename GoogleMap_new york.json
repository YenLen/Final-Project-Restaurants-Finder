I had to call security to come unlock the door for her. The solution was to keep the deadbolt extended...\n\nThe room, especially during the morning hours, was extremely loud. There is practically no sound proofing, and the hotel has very thin walls. I wouldn't expect to sleep past 7 or relax in the mornings. There are also loud and persistent alarms coming from somewhere close outside that went off multiple times during our stay, one time for over an hour at midnight.\n\nOverall, the general decor and design is modern and nice, but you can see the rooms are starting to show their age. The rooms are very basic - no coffee, fridge, ice markers are nowhere to be found. There's a $45 daily resort fee, and they didn't even put bottles of water in the rooms.\n\nEverything felt more 3 star rather than 4. Next time, we'll stay around the corner for about the same price."

Lobby space is pretty as in the pictures.  the food in the restaurant is good. Location is excellent, with access to subways to anywhere in the city and so much to walk to.  I much prefer this part of Manhattan for hotels instead of Times Square.\nThe restaurants that you find nearby seem to be a better deal and more interesting and Scaled smaller / more intimately.  I wish the government made prices reflect all the little add-ons though. It\u2019s not nice to be tricked By amenity fees.   I guess that\u2019s how things are done."

There bed was okay and there were only two pillows. The last night of our stay was very windy and the room got really noisy all night long.\n\nThey charge $45 \"property fee\" per night. Not sure what that's for. Maybe for using the elevators? There was not even free coffee in the lobby."

While waiting, the hostess ensured that the staff would bring an entree to compensate for our long wait time. The food was very good. I wish I could say the same about the customer service. We confronted the hostess Gracie about the lack of delivery when it comes to the entree that should have been sent to the table. Her response was less than impressive as she stated, \"Okay.

I said no but I told him I was a regular there and if it is possible for me to get desert. This guy that I have never seen before said in a condensing look and tone \"We would love to have you when the place is open\". I felt that was uncalled for and he could have just said we are closed now and I would have been fine with that. This guy is not the right person for this establishment. Eden ran this place very well and she was the sweetest manager anyone can ask for. This guy with a vest really does not understand customer service; something that I like about Capital Grille.

They even do special shapes for certain dim sum, which look nice but do taste the same as if you ordered the regular dim sum."

There were very few push carts like traditional dim sum places and we had to order almost everything off of the menu. The service was absolutely horrendous. We weren't even served water until after our food started coming out and we had to ask about four times to get it. The servers seemed super annoyed to be asked for anything and they were really rude. The food was decent, but the service ruined the whole experience. I also didn't like that they charged everyone $1 for hot tea when no one ordered it and it was already sitting on our table when we sat down. Of course we drank it when they withheld water from us for the first half an hour, but to just charge $1 a person for tea that was never ordered is not cool. And then, to top it off, one of the servers told us to leave the tip in cash! My friend and I couldn't believe she would have the audacity to say something like that at all, especially after the terrible service we had just suffered through. I never expect good service from these types of places, but this place was especially bad. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."

There was no dipping sauce for the scallion pancakes and the fried shrimp rolls were not topped off with Worcestershire sauce.
