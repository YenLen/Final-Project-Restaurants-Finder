# Final-Project-Restaurants-Finder
**SI 507 Final Project - Restaurants Finder**

In this project, I use **Google Map API** and **Yelp Fusion API** to create a restaurants finder. 

You can directly run the ```restaurantslist.py``` file in terminal.
The system will prompt the user with some questions.
1. Enter a city
2. Choose a source between Google Map or Yelp? (Google/Yelp)
- If choosing Yelp, it will display a list of restaurants with Yelp ratings.
- If choosing Google Map, it will display a list of restaurants with ratings which sorted by the price levels.
3. Which restaurant would you like to go?
- The user have to enter a restaurant name from the list. It will show the travel time and also 5 reviews with corresponding ratings from Google Map.
