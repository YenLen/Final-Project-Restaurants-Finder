It's one thing to make take out customers pay for soup and salad with the meal, but making people request and pay for wasabi and ginger WITH sushi is a scam.\n\nAnd I would even be ok with that if they were understanding as a business, but when we called to request the ginger and wasabi (mind you we got the soy sauce from the same button) they said we were lying. When I asked them to remake our 3 hot rolls on a 16 item order for when we come pick up the ginger and wasabi the response from the Manager was to bring them back in to the restaurant and they would take them to the kitchen and reheat them for us. Not remake. Reheat.\n\nSo we basically got blamed for not hitting a button we did hit, or why would we have soy sauce, and then called liars. Very argumentative and poor service. Will never return. DO NOT ORDER TAKE OUT FROM THIS RESTAURANT!!!!"

The food was prepared quickly, but always with attention to quality and detail.  I have a sinking feeling that the 1207 store is phoning it in.  Last night my sandwiches came out of the wrappers a complete mess, with avocado all over the outside of the bread, like they forgot to put it in and decided to smear it on at the last minute, after making the rest of the sandwich.  Last week, I ordered two identical sandwiches and one weighed about 30% less than the other.  Worse, neither of them was made to order.  There's just so little consistency and apparent attention to detail that I can't justify ordering from this store anymore.  And it saddens me, because ordering Jimmy John's used to be a real treat in our household, a special occasion that we could look forward to."

Thank You so much!\n\nManagement consider having 2 employees working the busy times in the store. To give assistance to the employees.\n\nThe reason we came to this subway was because the first one was closed due to ac problem, the second refused to serve us because the one employees was on break.

        "text": "My son and I stopped in to grab a bite to eat. We both ordered different corned beef sandwiches. My son had ordered the larger sandwich, which was priced the same as what I had ordered. When they arrived, I was actually a bit shocked to see the size difference between the two. My sandwich only had a few slices of meat versus the absolutely mound on his. I wouldn't have cared much, except were the exact same price with no additional items for the smaller one to compensate. Had we not ordered the same thing I would likely had not noticed or even said anything, but the side by side comparison was hard to notice. The only other issue was the sheer amount of oil(butter?) that was in the sandwich was so overwhelming it was hard to eat. After it started getting a little cold, it was unappealing.\n\nI spoke to the waitress, who asked the manager to come over regarding the issue. I wasn't upset, but genuinely curious as to how the restaurant could charge the same for these two hugely disproportionate items. I wanted them to be able to see the sandwich size difference, since a visual reference helped. From our seat, I could see the manager's reaction to the waitresses comments. The manager went back to the bar and finished her conversation with the people at the bar, cleaned up and after about 10 minutes came over to resolve the issue. The manager explained that while his order should have had double the size, it shouldn't have been this big of a difference. She removed one sandwich from the bill and did provide a gift certificate for future use, but this wasn't really what I was looking for. She didn't address the question, which is how the restaurant justifies charging the same amount for two different amounts of food? This was just sort of shrugged off. Whether it's double or triple the size, that's a huge difference that someone setting the two meals side by side will question. Maybe it wasn't originally supposed to be that way, and someone who doesn't know the food served or the restaurant created this menu and price. I will use the gift card provided to visit them in the future and see if they have resolved these small issues."

This bar I've envisioned is the exact opposite of this one. If you want to pay the most you've ever paid without getting buzzed you've come to the right place. On top of that if you want to have a conversation with your friends the best bet is just going outside and never looking back. Menu prices don't reflect the prices you will be charged on your bill. You'll have a cheaper experience by charging yourself twice the price for a fifth of liquor yourself, wouldn't recommend to my worst enemies."
